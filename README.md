# Amanda Migala


> Have Courage, and be Kind.

Hi my name is Amanda Migala and I am a Visual Communication Designer, and I am certified in User Experience and Web Development. I grew up being more on the creative side rather then the logical side 
and loved to come with things that I imagined though drawing, photography, and story telling. When I graduated high school, I remember my drama teacher mentioning to me how 
I was a quiet genius who embraced so much creativity during my years in school and hoped I would continue that during college. From then on, 
I decided to persure design as my major not just because of the creative part of it but also to gain skills in problem solving that could impact others I work with. 
I tend have an open minded when I try new things. I love trying to be outside especially in the summer and go biking, hiking, or swimming.
