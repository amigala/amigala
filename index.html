<h1>Amanda Migala</h1>

<p>Hi my name is Amanda Migala and I am a VCD design major at Eastern Washington University. I grew up being more on the creative side rather then the logical side and loved to come with things 
  that I imagined though drawing or story telling. When I graduated high school, I remember my drama teacher mentioning to me how I was a quiet genius who embraced so much creativity during my years in school 
and hoped I would continue that during college. From then on, I decided to persure design as my major not just because of the creative part of it but also to gain skills in problem solving that could impact others I work with. 
I tend to try and be open minded to new things and try something new either work wise or just for fun. I love trying to be outside especially in the summer and go biking, hiking, or swimming.</p>
